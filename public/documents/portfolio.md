PORTFOLIO

**About Me:**

I am a GIS Analyst with over seven years of experience in spatial data management, hazard mapping, and urban planning across Bhutan. I have contributed to major national initiatives including the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI), the Southern Central Regional Plan, Bhutan’s nationwide property taxation building database, and the Thimphu-Paro Urban Resilience project. My work focuses on transforming complex geospatial data into clear, actionable insights for planning and decision-making. I am committed to advancing data-driven, climate-resilient urban development through modern GIS and spatial technologies.

**Establishing GIS in Gelephu Thromde**   
From January 2019 to December 2022, I served as a GIS Officer in Gelephu Thromde, where I pioneered the introduction of GIS at a time when both the designation and the concept were new to the organization. I developed a comprehensive geodatabase covering land parcels, infrastructure, utilities, and other critical spatial layers, creating a reliable foundation for urban data management. I worked closely with urban planners, engineers, and environmental officers to integrate GIS into day-to-day governance, planning, and service delivery.

 **Leading Zoning and COVID-19 Response for Sarpang Dzongkhag (2020 – 2022\)**

Led the Zoning Task Force for Sarpang Dzongkhag during the COVID-19 pandemic. I coordinated closely with the Department of Human Settlement to support household data collection in Gelephu Thromde and worked with the Sarpang Dzongkhag Surveillance Team to track COVID-19 cases, map high-risk and red buildings, and identify emerging clusters. I led GIS-enabled door-to-door household surveillance and supported mass screening operations to enable timely detection and containment. Through the effective use of geospatial data, this work strengthened crisis management, supported rapid decision-making, and enhanced cross-sector coordination. The initiative demonstrated the critical role of GIS in emergency response and its value in improving public health and safety outcomes.

**National Property Taxation and Building Database (Jan 2023 – Present)**

Since January 2023, I have been serving as a Senior GIS Officer in the Department of Human Settlement, leading the development of Bhutan’s nationwide Property Taxation and Building Database. I coordinated and supervised a national team of over 250 supervisors and enumerators to collect detailed building and dwelling data across 66 urban centers, completing the exercise within seven months. I introduced a QR-based building identification system to enable continuous data updates, verification, and long-term geospatial data management. Working closely with the Department of Revenue and Customs and the National Land Commission Secretariat, I supported the integration of building and parcel datasets, forming the technical foundation for Bhutan’s new Property Tax System. The resulting high-quality geospatial datasets now support property taxation reforms, housing policy development, and evidence-based urban planning nationwide.

**Technical Working Group (TWG) Member, Southern Central Regional Plan Project:** Collaborated closely with JICA experts, national stakeholders, and local consultants throughout the regional planning process, leading the GIS and Environmental sub-group. Conducted field visits and provided spatial analysis and environmental inputs to inform the Regional Development Strategy, the Sarpang–Gelephu Regional Centre Structure Plan, and the formulation of general standards and guidelines for nationwide urban and regional planning initiatives.
